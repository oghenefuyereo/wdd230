    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The website of the South Niagara Chamber of Commerce serves as an extensive internet platform dedicated to
      empowering and assisting the local business community in South Niagara. During the planning process, the site's
      purpose is defined as being a central repository of information, offering specifics regarding chamber events,
      initiatives, and business resource offerings. Additionally, it aims to facilitate networking among members,
      advertise local businesses through directories and classifieds, and advocate for legislation that benefits them.
      The scope of the website encompasses member resources, event management tools, and a direct line of contact
      between the chamber and its members. By providing this comprehensive suite of features, the website plays a vital
      role in supporting the growth and success of South Niagara businesses."
      This expanded statement clearly articulates both the purpose and scope of the website, providing a thorough
      understanding of its role in serving the local business community.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Scenario 1: Local Entrepreneur Interested in Joining the Chamber
      This scenario prompts content development related to membership information, including benefits, fees, and the
      application process. It highlights the need for a clear and informative Membership page on the website, detailing
      the advantages of joining the chamber and guiding potential members through the application procedure.
      Scenario 2: Small Business Owner Seeking Information on Advocacy Efforts
      This scenario drives content development concerning the chamber's advocacy initiatives. It emphasizes the
      importance of showcasing the chamber's advocacy efforts, recent initiatives, and collaborations with government
      agencies. This information should be readily accessible on the website's Advocacy page to inform and engage
      visitors about the chamber's proactive role in supporting local businesses.
      Scenario 3: Visitor Exploring Local Businesses and Attractions
      This scenario encourages content development focused on promoting local businesses and attractions. It underscores
      the need for a comprehensive Business Directory and an Explore South Niagara page on the website. These sections
      should provide visitors with easy access to information about member businesses, restaurants, accommodations,
      tourist attractions, and upcoming events, facilitating their exploration of the community.</p>
